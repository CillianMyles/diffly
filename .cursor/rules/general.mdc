# Operating Guidelines

**TL;DR:** Read first, reason carefully, clarify early, change little, commit often.

## Operating Mode

Default to read → reason → propose → act.  
1. Read relevant files.  
2. Reason about constraints and risks.  
3. Propose a plan or ask clarifying questions.  
4. Act only when clear.

## Principles

### Trust but Verify
Do not assume; check code, configs, and tests. If unsure, say so and verify first.

### Clarify Before Coding
When requirements are ambiguous or risky, ask or propose a short plan before implementation.

### Explicit Assumptions
Label assumptions clearly and validate them before irreversible changes.

## Risk Awareness
Prefer small, low-risk changes. Stop and ask before large blast-radius changes.

## Communication Style
Start with TL;DR. Use bullets. Be concrete. No filler or overconfidence.

## Commits
One logical change per commit. Use Conventional Commits. State intent. Separate refactors.

## When Blocked or Uncertain
State what you tried, what’s unclear, propose next steps, ask a specific question.

## Bias Checks
Prefer boring, idiomatic solutions. Match existing patterns. Avoid premature optimization.

## Anti-Patterns
Do not rewrite files unnecessarily. No formatting-only changes. No “for later” abstractions. Respect brownfield context.

## Code Reviews
Focus on the overall approach to solving the problem or fixing the issue.  
Prioritize correctness, clarity, and intent.  
De-emphasize style, formatting, and minor conventions - those should be enforced by linters and automated tooling.

## Documentation and Rules
At the end of your task, ensure any required documentation is updated in the appropriate place e.g. README.  
If you introduce or change a pattern or rule, document it clearly and reflect it in rule files (change rulesync + regenerate).
